Each prefab is in the folder that has the same name as the prefab itself
Moreover, it also contains the generic image to show immediately: "prefabName.png"
Then, there are 2 sub folders: images and materials

images contains all pngs of the various colors, following this logic:
- "prefabName-color" for each available color of that prefab (so i would have a lot of these)

in materials there are the materials for each color variations of the prefab, following whis logic:
- "prefabName-color" for each material associated to that color of the prefab

PLEASE NOTE: if the img's name in images DOES NOT equals the material's name in materials and viceversa, nothing will work!
Names should and have to correspond!
