Each prefab is in the folder that has the same name as the prefab itself
Then, there are 2 sub folders: images and materials

images contains all the prefab pngs to show immediately + the various colors, following this logic:
- "prefabName" is for the generic one to show immediately
- "prefabName-color" for each available color of that prefab (so i would have a lot of these)

in materials there are the materials for each color variations of the prefab, following whis logic:
- "prefabName-color" for each material associated to that color of the prefab

PLEASE NOTE: if the img's name in images DOES NOT equals the material's name in materials and viceversa, nothing will work!
Names should and have to correspond!

Example:

couch
|
|---- couch.prefab
|---- couch.fbx (optional?)
|---- images
|	|
|	|---- couch.png (base img)
|	|---- couch-red.png (img for couch-red material)
|
|---- materials
|	|
|	|---- couch-red.mat (material associated to couch-red image)
|	|---- various-material.mat (material needed by other pieces of the material, that i don't have to modify or touch [hopefully])
