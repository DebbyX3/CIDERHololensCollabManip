# CIDER: Collaborative Interior Design in Extended Reality



## About

CIDER (Collaborative Interior Design in Extended Reality) is a Hololens 2 application to allow collaborative manipulation between two or more users in mixed (or augmented) reality. 
Build in C# with Unity and the [Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit 2 (MRTK2)](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity).

It is an implementation of the system described in our corresponding paper: https://doi.org/10.1145/3605390.3605419

## Goal

This work proposes (and evaluates) a system for shared collaborative interior design tasks, specifically the editing of augmented 3D scenes in co-located collaborative virtual environments (CVEs).

Goals: 
- Allow designers and non-designers to create spaces together
- Let users devise ideas independently, without surprises
- Share only valid ideas

It achieves them by letting users:
- Propose different variations of objects and scenes
- Compare the results
- Discuss them
- Create optimally merged results
